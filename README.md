This repository contains an implementation of the [GloVe][1] word vector learning algorithm in Python 2 (NumPy + SciPy). (A contributed Python 3 version is available [here][3].)

You can follow along with the [accompanying tutorial][2] on my blog.

The implementation is for educational purposes only; you should look elsewhere if you are looking for an efficient / robust solution.
